# GRC News Assistant

This Python-based tool requires minimal coding experience for users to collect Cybersecurity Governance, Risk, and Compliance related news articles (or any topic of interest) using the NewsData.io API, with ratings powered by Fabric AI. You just add keywords of interest to a CSV file, run the script (e.g., daily), and it adds news articles to a spreadsheet, with ratings from "S Tier (Must Consume Original Content Immediately)" to "C Tier (Maybe Skip It)." This capability provides GRC professionals with a bank of quick-to-access relevant cyber news stories to help win hearts and minds for cyber risk reduction with executives, managers, IT practitioners, and end users.

This project is inspired by and builds upon the work of several excellent open-source projects:

- [grcAssist by Dr. Gerald Auger - The original GRC news assistant](https://github.com/gerryguy311/grcAssist)
- [fabric by Daniel Miessler - Provides the AI-powered analysis capabilities with the label_and_rate pattern/prompt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)
- [NP4k-extractor by nopslip - URL to fabric processing](https://github.com/nopslip/NP4k-extractor)

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Python 3.7 or higher
   ```bash
   #Check python version
   python3 --version
   ```
3. [fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) - Must be installed separately. I have a step-by-step blog post with a video walkthrough here: https://www.cpatocybersecurity.com/p/install-the-new-fabric
4. OS-specific clipboard tools:
   - macOS: Built-in with pbpaste, no additional installation needed
   - Linux: Install xclip
     ```bash
     # Ubuntu/Debian
     sudo apt-get install xclip
     
     # Fedora
     sudo dnf install xclip
     ```
   - Windows: Built-in PowerShell commands used, no additional installation needed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cpatocybersecurity/GRCnewsAssistant
   cd GRCnewsAssistant
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   # Create a virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate virtual environment
   ```
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   # With virtual environment activated:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up NLTK data:
   ```
   # With virtual environment activated:
   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
   ```

## API Key Setup

This tool requires a NewsData.io API key. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Sign up for a free account at [NewsData.io](https://newsdata.io)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Set your API key as an environment variable:

   For macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   #Edit your shell's startup file
   nano ~/.zshrc

   #add this line to your shell's startup file to make it permanent
   export NEWSDATA_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   
   #Or .bashrc, etc. depending on your environment
   ```
   
   For Windows (Command Prompt):
   ```cmd
   set NEWSDATA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   For Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   $env:NEWSDATA_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your keywords:
   - Modify the file named `keywords.csv` in the same directory as the script, with new items of interest
   - Add one keyword per line, or multiple words per line with "%20" in spaces between words 

2. Configure fabric for your LLM of choice
   ```
   fabric --setup
   [1] claude-3-5-haiku-latest
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   #Go to the grcnewsassistant directory if you're not already there
   cd grcnewsassistant

   #Activate the virtual enviornment if it's not already activated, e.g. for macOS/Linus:
   source venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   #Execute the script   
   python GRCnewsAssistant.py
   ```

The script will:
- Search for news articles matching your keywords in `keywords.csv` (using NewsData.io)
- Extract article content (with Newspaper4k) and rate the content using the fabric [label_and_rate](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/label_and_rate/system.md) pattern/prompt and your LLM of choice
- Save the analyzed results to `grcdata_rated.csv`

## Output Files

- `urls.csv`: List of article URLs generated by NewsData.io, which are an input to Newspaper4k to extract article content and send it for rating
- `grcdata_rated.csv`: Enhanced dataset including AI analysis results

## Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling and will provide clear messages if:
- The API key is not set
- Required clipboard tools are missing (Linux)
- Keywords file is missing or empty
- API requests fail
- Article processing encounters issues

## Operating System Compatibility

The script is compatible with:
- macOS (uses built-in pbcopy/pbpaste)
- Linux (requires xclip)
- Windows (uses PowerShell's Get-Clipboard)

## Troubleshooting

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Ensure the environment variable is set correctly
   - Check if your API key is valid at NewsData.io

2. **Linux Clipboard Issues**
   - Verify xclip is installed: `which xclip`
   - Try reinstalling xclip if needed

3. **Windows PowerShell Issues**
   - Ensure you're running with appropriate permissions
   - Try running PowerShell as administrator if needed
